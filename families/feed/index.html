										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RPGNJ is a voluntary service provided at no cost to families who are dealing with the effects of parental substance use. RPGNJ assists parents who are considering a change in their substance use and provides services to them and their families throughout the recovery process.

<p><strong>Who is eligible?</strong><br />
Parents who have not yet entered treatment for their current episode of substance use. If children are in out-of-home care, they must have a primary case goal of reunification and be in placement less than 18 months.</p>
<p><strong>What is the referral process?</strong><br />
Referrals will be accepted from families themselves, Family Court, co-occurring and substance use treatment, and recovery organizations. <a href="https://NorthernNJhealth.org/refer-rpgnj/">Click here for more information.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Northernnj staff work with parents to enhance their parenting skills and offer them community resources to ensure that their children are receiving the necessary care to grow and develop. Our supportive staff work to promote positive parenting, child wellbeing, and strong family bonds.</h4>
<h4>Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)</h4>
<p>PCIT is a fun, interactive therapy for children ages 2 to 8 and their parents. We help parents learn effective ways to get a child’s undesirable behaviors to stop. Undesirable behaviors exhibited by children include disruptiveness, acting out at school or home, failure to pay attention or follow simple directions, and having frequent temper tantrums.</p>
<h4>Parent Management Training</h4>
<p>Negative behaviors in the home can have long-term effects for both parents and teenagers/pre-teens. This evidenced based therapy helps families learn successful ways of interacting.</p>
<h4>Pre and Post Adoption Support</h4>
<p>Skilled therapists trained in the unique needs of foster, adoptive, and birth families work to ease all stages of the adoption process.</p>
<h4>Telehealth Services</h4>
<p>Together, we are facing truly unprecedented circumstances. <a href="https://NorthernNJhealth.org/coronavirus">COVID-19</a> is affecting our families, our communities, and our way of life. Our top priority is providing additional care for those experiencing stress and anxiety due to these extraordinary circumstances. Northernnj is now accepting new clients for counseling services via telehealth—a remote phone or online therapy &#038; counseling solution.<br />
