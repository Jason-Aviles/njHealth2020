Through the Bridge program, this population is given the option of receiving mental health and non-mental health services when released into the community.  Program staff works in collaboration with the Gloucester County Jail staff and Community Providers to create a seamless transition from the jail to the community.  Transition planning is critical to the success of the client after release.  During the period of incarceration, program staff develops a pre-release plan that outlines the client’s resource needs.  Coordination of identified services begins prior to release to ensure that the client’s immediate needs are addressed upon release.  Case management services continue in the community with contact occurring in the client’s residence.  Psychotropic medications are provided without cost to the client until benefits are in place.  The case manager assures that all required followup is completed and that all necessary services are in place. Clients are monitored in the community for approximately 3 to 6 months. Client support is then maintained by community providers where the consumer has accepted services. Services are client driven and focus on the strengths and needs of the individual. Participation is voluntary and involves learning skills that will promote the client's ability to manage the illness and make responsible choices in all areas of life.</p><h5 class="title">Counties served:</h5><p> Gloucester</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title"><a href="../programs/cape-community-home/index.html">Cape Community Home</a></h5><p class="card-text">Cape Community home is a Psychiatric Community Residence serving youth ages 11-17.</p><h5 class="title">Counties served:</h5><p> Cape May</p></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="card"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title"><a href="../programs/certified-community-behavioral-health-clinic-ccbhc/index.html">Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC)</a></h5><p class="card-text">EXPANDING CARE TO THOSE IN NEED
