					<description><![CDATA[Hello!
My name is Sabrina Santiago,
I&#039;m a parent  of a 15 year old son that&#039;s need some help. I&#039;ve been struggling with my son and it&#039;s been and is very stressful, My son Juan has been hanging with the wrong crowd, he&#039;s been leaving home while i&#039;m at work and come late a nite , He is in a BD class, which is for Behavioral room. He talks back to him, sometimes he won&#039;t even come home, One day he ran away. He says something about being in a gang, He been coming home kind of fishy, I think he is doing drugs. I want some kind of help for my child before it&#039;s too late. I tell him I don&#039;t want him with this other boys he don&#039;t listen. I have holes in my door cause his anger. I told him I was going to call Mobile Responce to take him. I&#039;m fed up and tired of this situation. Can you please help me. I need help ASAP. No mother would not like seeing their child in a situation like this and I know there is worse.

Please contact me at 856-212-4217
Thank you.
