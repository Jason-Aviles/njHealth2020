<p><span data-contrast="none">Helping the local community is very important to me.

	<h5><strong>When did you first get involved with NorthernNJ? </strong></h5>
<p>My first encounter with NorthernNJ was in 1999-2000 when my family needed resources. Robins’ Nest (now NorthernNJ) was there to help steer us through a difficult time. A few years later, when I worked for the County of Gloucester, I was able to see close-up the impact NorthernNJ had on the community through the Community Development Block Grant program that helped support some of the provided services. I was incredibly honored to further become part of such a dynamic organization when I was asked to join the board.</p>
<h5><strong>What attracted you to the NorthernNJ mission?</strong></h5>
<p>NorthernNJ's mission ensures that children, individuals and families have the tools and support to be successful, which in turn, helps to strengthen our communities.Being part of something that builds better lives is really a spiritual gift and helping others is good for the soul.</p>
<h5><strong>Why do you volunteer/donate?</strong></h5>
<p>I truly subscribe to the notion that everyone has time, talent and treasures that should be shared with others. No matter how vibrant a community may be, there is always someone who may need a helping hand. It is up to those of us who have these resources to give back when and as we can. If not me, who? Besides, giving back feels good!</p>

<div class="siteorigin-widget-tinymce textwidget">
	<h5><strong>What motivates you to stay involved? In your opinion, what is the most important work that NorthernNJ does?</strong></h5>
<p>One of the things I find most impressive about NorthernNJ is how focused the organization is on providing not only what is needed in the community today, but looking forward to what will be needed in the future. As board members, it’s our job to ensure the resources are there to serve the community for the long term, even if it means getting creative in our thought process. Making sure that not one person, not one family that could have been helped is left behind is my motivation.</p>
<h5><strong>What do you hope NorthernNJ will achieve in the near future? In the long term?</strong></h5>
<p>If nothing else, this year (2020) has shown us that everything changes. My hope for NorthernNJ is to have the resources to overcome whatever challenges may lie ahead. This organization will continue to thrive and grow for many, many years to come, not just for people we serve, but also to be there for the amazing staff at NorthernNJ who really dedicate their expertise to make a difference.</p>
<h5><strong>Do you have an anecdote about NorthernNJ that really moved you?</strong></h5>
<p>A client who shared her personal story at last year’s NorthernNJ merger celebration described in detail how every step of the way someone at NorthernNJ was there to guide her, teach her and support her as she made her way into adulthood. I was so proud when I heard how the staff went the extra mile to make a difference, even helping her get a driver’s license. I couldn’t stop thinking about it without smiling for weeks!</p>
<h5><strong>Why is being a donor so important to you?</strong></h5>
<p>Organizations such as NorthernNJ are constantly challenged to provide the services the community needs under increasingly tightened budgets. Donor support helps bridge potential gaps to make sure supportive programs don’t disappear in a time when they are most needed.</p>
<h5><strong>What would you tell to others interested in getting involved with NorthernNJ?</strong></h5>
<p>Volunteerism comes in many forms. No matter how big or small, your involvement WILL make a difference.</p>

<h6>When did you get involved with NorthernNJ?</h6>
<p><span data-contrast="none">I became involved with </span><span data-contrast="none">NorthernNJ</span><span data-contrast="none"> because of the mission and people involved. I initially met Dr. </span><span data-contrast="none">DiFabio</span><span data-contrast="none"> six years ago, through my career in banking.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The work </span><span data-contrast="auto">NorthernNJ</span><span data-contrast="auto"> does is so vital.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>What do you hope NorthernNJ will achieve in the near future? In the long term?</h6>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">NorthernNJ has an awesome <a href="https://NorthernNJhealth.org/about/">mission</a> and I believe their goal now and in the future would be to reach as many people and families in need, providing the necessary help and pathway to a better life and a brighter future.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
