										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Traumatic Loss Coalitions for Youth Program (TLC) at Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care is New Jersey’s primary youth suicide prevention program and is funded by the Department of Children and Families, Division of Child Behavioral Health Services. The TLC is an interactive, statewide network that offers education, collaboration, and support to professionals working with school-age youth. The dual mission of the TLC is excellence in suicide prevention and trauma response assistance to schools following unfortunate losses due to suicide, homicide, accident, and illness. This is accomplished through county, regional, and statewide conferences, training, consultation, and technical assistance. The purpose is to ensure that those working with youth from a variety of disciplines and programs have up-to-date knowledge about mental health issues, suicide prevention, trauma response, and resiliency enhancement.</p>
<p>The TLCs are available to:<br />
Provide county coalition meetings for the purpose of networking, disseminating information, and reviewing best practices in the areas of mental health, traumatic loss and suicide prevention. Educator Professional Development Credits are available for attending the educational component of these meetings.<br />
Provide schools with assistance from the TLC’s Lead Response Teams (LRT) in the event of a traumatic loss. Assistance can range from phone consultation and support to the provision of on-site services.<br />
Coordinate a two hour Suicide Awareness Training for Educators to fulfill the professional development requirement, per N.J.S.A. 18A:6-11.<br />
Consult with schools and communities regarding evidence-based suicide curricula. This consultation can help schools fulfill the requirements of the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards.</p>
